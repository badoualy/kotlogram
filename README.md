[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/badoualy/kotlogram.svg?label=jitpack)](https://jitpack.io/#badoualy/kotlogram)
===========
> **Easy to use** and **straightforward** Kotlin (and Java) binding of [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/api).
> The project is coded in **Kotlin**, with some classes (mostly legacy classes cloned from ex3nder library, see below for more details)
> The Java code will be replaced by Kotlin over time

> **Kotlin, what is that, I don't know this language!** 
> Don't worry, Kotlin is a JVM language just like Java and Scala, and is interoperable with Java! You can use this as a standard Java Library

Beta
----------------
The project is still in beta, a lot is yet to be done. It comes with absolutely no warranty!
Main tasks left:
- Implement [Perfect Forward Secrecy](https://core.telegram.org/api/pfs).
- Use the method to get more salts and save them in storage. Currently the first request will be sent with a bad salt, and resent when a good salt is received.
- Improve error handling for the requests, and the exceptions in the mtproto module.
- Implement tests

Usage
----------------
#### Dependency

First, add [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/) to your project if that's not already the case, in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

Then add the library dependency:
```gradle
compile 'com.github.badoualy:kotlogram:0.0.3'
```


#### Example
```java
TelegramApp app = new TelegramApp(API_ID, API_HASH, MODEL, SYSTEM_VERSION, APP_VERSION, LANG_CODE);

// This is a synchronous client, that will block until the response arrive (or until timeout)
// A client which returns an Observable<T> where T is the response type will be available soon
TelegramClient client = Kotlogram.getDefaultClient(app, new ApiStorage());

// You can start making requests
try {
    TLAbsSentCode sentCode = client.authSendCode(PHONE_NUMBER, 5);
    System.out.println("Authentication code: ");
    String code = new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();
    TLAuthorization authorization = client.authSignIn(PHONE_NUMBER, sentCode.getPhoneCodeHash(), code);
    TLUserSelf self = (TLUserSelf) authorization.getUser();
    System.out.println("You are now signed in as " + self.getFirstName() + " " + self.getLastName());

    // Start making cool stuff!
    TLAbsDialogs dialogs = client.messagesGetDialogs(0, 0, 0);
    // Do something with recent chats :)
} catch (RpcErrorException e) {
    // Error with the request, invalid argument, etc
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Network error
    e.printStackTrace();
}

client.close(); // Important, do not forget this, or your process won't finish
System.err.println("------------------------- GOOD BYE");
```


Structure
----------------
The project is composed by the following modules:
- [tl-builder: Type Language compiler](#tl-builder-type-language-compiler)
- [tl: Type Language library](#tl-type-language-library)
- [mtproto: MTProto Mobile Protocol library](#mtproto-mtproto-mobile-protocol-implementation)
- [api](#api)


tl-builder: [Type Language](http://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) compiler
----------------
Converts json-representation of [TL Schema](http://core.telegram.org/schema) to Java classes with generated classes for serializing and deserializing api messages and methods to their binary representation (see [Binary Data Serialization](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/serialize)).
#### Usage
1. Get json-cheme of required api-level on [Telegram website](http://core.telegram.org/schema) and put it in ```tl-builder\src\main\resources\```
2. Run the main class in tl-builder module with the name of the previously downloaded file (not fullpath)

The classes will be generated in the ```tl``` module in the package ```com.github.badoualy.telegram.tl.api```.


tl: [Type Language]() library
----------------
Contains the base type of the Type Language (int, long, Vecor, ...) and the classes generated by the ```tl-builder```. This module is the lowest level in the library, it supplies all the necessary classes to serialize/deserialize objects describe in the [TL Schema](https://core.telegram.org/schema).
#### About TL Language
"*TL Language (Type Language or Time Limit) serves to describe the used system of types, constructors, and existing functions. In fact, the combinator description format presented in Binary Data Serialization is used.*"


mtproto: [MTProto Mobile Protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) library
----------------
Contains all the necessary stuff to make RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and handle all the low-level stuff (like handling salt, etc.)
#### About MTProto..

**MTProto** is the [Telegram Messenger](http://www.telegram.org ) protocol 
_"designed for access to a server API from applications running on mobile devices"_.

The Mobile Protocol is subdivided into three components ([from the official site](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto#general-description)):

 - High-level component (API query language): defines the method whereby API 
 queries and responses are converted to binary messages.
 
 - Cryptographic (authorization) layer: defines the method by which messages 
 are encrypted prior to being transmitted through the transport protocol.      
 
 - Transport component: defines the method for the client and the server to transmit 
 messages over some other existing network protocol (such as, http, https, tcp, udp).


api
----------------
High-level API to easily use Telegram's [api methods](https://core.telegram.org/methods) without having to understand the first thing about MTProto or TL Language :)
An old fashioned Java API (like using [RestFB](https://github.com/restfb/restfb) or a any Rest API binding)

#### Usage
See [here](#Usage) for usage examples


[ex3ndr](https://github.com/ex3ndr)'s work
----------------
The different projects of ex3ndr are supposed to supply a library to use Telegram API without having to deal with the MTProto or Type Language, but for several reasons I found it impossible to use, mainly because the project is currently dead, which causes the following issues:
- The supplied version is based on Telegram API layer 12, current layer is 18. You can more or less easily update the TL Language using his builder (which I found not to be working on Windows, at least the part the build the jar) but some other stuff has changed.
- The [Type Language compiler](https://github.com/ex3ndr/telegram-tl) use a very old version of Kotlin, which means that if you clone the project, you won't be able to run it as it is. This complicates a lot the work to modify how the schema is compiled into Java classes.
- The architecture of the MTProto implementation is really complicated and not very straightforward.
- The ```AuthUtils``` class to execute the "Creating an Authorization Key" flow doesn't follow the [Perfect Forward Secrecy](https://core.telegram.org/api/pfs): you can only generate a permanent key.

For this reasons, the followings are based on his work:
- The **tl-builder** and **tl** modules were cloned from (see [telegram-tl ](https://github.com/ex3ndr/telegram-tl) (builder) and [telegram-tl-core](https://github.com/ex3ndr/telegram-tl-core)) and modified for me needs. Mostly renaming classes and packages.
- The **mtproto** module low-level classes (crypto/utils classes) are based on his implementation (cloned from his project and modified) (see [telegram-mt](https://github.com/ex3ndr/telegram-mt)).
